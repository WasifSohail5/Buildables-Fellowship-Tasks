    "\n",
    "Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are using a gen AI tool to create a healthy three-course menu that requires a certain number of calories, which prompting element will ensure the menu is more practical?\n",
    "Answer: By setting clear constraints and giving sample inputs—like through one-shot prompting—the menu will be more realistic and usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "When the initial prompt \"Create a dataset\" is too broad, what should you do to refine it?\n",
    "Answer: You should make it more specific by including details such as the dataset’s subject, required size, structure, and preferred output format.\n"
